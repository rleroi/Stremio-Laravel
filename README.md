# Stremio-Laravel
A Stremio Addon Template in Laravel PHP

# Usage
1. Click the "[Use this template](https://github.com/rleroi/Stremio-Laravel/generate)" button on the top of this page to create a new project.
2. Clone your new repository
3. Run `composer install && npm install && composer run post-root-package-install && composer run post-create-project-cmd`
4. If you have Docker installed, you can run `./vendor/bin/sail up` to run the application locally ([see Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation#laravel-and-docker))
5. Just add your content to [AddonController.php](https://github.com/rleroi/Stremio-Laravel/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/AddonController.php).

The addon routes are predefined in [routes/addon.php](https://github.com/rleroi/Stremio-Laravel/blob/master/routes/addon.php), there should be no need to change them.
