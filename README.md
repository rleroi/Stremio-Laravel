# Stremio-Laravel
A Stremio Addon Template in Laravel PHP

# Usage
Just add your content to [AddonController.php](https://github.com/rleroi/Stremio-Laravel/blob/master/app/Http/Controllers/AddonController.php).

Routes are predefined in [routes/addon.php](https://github.com/rleroi/Stremio-Laravel/blob/master/routes/addon.php), there should be no need to change them.
